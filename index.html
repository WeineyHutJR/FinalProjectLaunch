        <p><strong>DAKOTA PARKER IS A SELF TAUGHT GRAPHIC ARTIST AND ILLUSTRATOR BASED IN JONESPORT, MAINE.</strong></p>
        <p>Dakota Parker is a self taught Graphic Designer. He currently enrolls in college to work upon a 4 year degree to become a more professional designer, so he can hopefully join a big time organization! Dakota started designing back in 2017 creating the simplest basketball cards for <strong><em>NBA2K</em></strong>, a website called 2kmtcentral and used <strong><em>Photopea</em></strong> as his use of designing. Now he currently makes the most insane creations, with 1.2K followers on <strong><em>Instagram</em></strong> and has celebrities such as <strong><em>Kevin Durant</em></strong>, <strong><em>Ray Allen</em></strong>, <strong><em>Mark DeCarlo</em></strong>, <strong><em>Eric Bauza</em></strong> and <strong><em>Rob Paulsen</em></strong> seen his work. He would love to achieve higher expectations in the skill.</p>
        <p>Graphic designers are professionals who use their creativity and technical skills to visually communicate messages or ideas through various forms of media. They work with clients or employers to create visual concepts, often using software tools like <strong><em>Adobe Photoshop</em></strong>, <strong><em>Illustrator</em></strong>, and <strong><em>InDesign</em></strong>, to develop designs for websites, advertisements, product packaging, logos, and more.</p>
        <p>Graphic designers must have a deep understanding of typography, color theory, and composition, as well as an eye for aesthetics and detail. They also need to be skilled in communication and collaboration, as they often work closely with other professionals such as marketers, writers, and developers to ensure that their designs meet the needs and objectives of their clients or employers.</p>
